Product Requirements Document (PRD)
Overview
This product aims to provide accurate and comprehensive web analytics by tracking and analyzing Page Views (PV). The system will monitor user behavior patterns, identify popular pages and potential issues, and suggest optimizations for improving user experience and increasing conversion rates.

Glossary
Page View (PV)
A page view represents an instance of a page being loaded in a browser. Each time a user opens or refreshes a webpage, it counts as one PV.

User Behavior Analysis
User behavior analysis involves the study of how users interact with a website, including navigation patterns, time spent on pages, bounce rates, scrolling depth, interaction behaviors, device types, and browser distribution.

Features
Total PV Count: Display the overall number of PVs on the website.
Daily/Weekly/Monthly PV Trends: Show daily, weekly, and monthly PV trends to understand usage patterns over time.
Page-Level PVs: Present the number of PVs for each page to identify the most popular pages.
Source/Medium PVs: Display the number of PVs from different sources and mediums to understand traffic sources.
User Behavior Analysis: Analyze user behavior patterns using various metrics such as page visit paths, time spent on pages, bounce rates, scrolling depth, interaction behaviors, device types, and browser distribution.
User Flow
The system captures and stores PV data.
The data is processed and analyzed to generate reports.
Reports are displayed in a user-friendly format, allowing stakeholders to review and interpret the data.
Based on the insights gained from the reports, stakeholders can make informed decisions to optimize the website and improve user experience.
Implementation Details
The system will utilize JavaScript to capture and send PV data to the server for processing and storage. A backend database will store the raw data, and a reporting engine will generate reports based on the stored data. Reports will be saved in Markdown format and can be automatically exported to HTML or PDF formats. Additionally, report data can be accessed via API for integration with other systems.
